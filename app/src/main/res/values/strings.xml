        - By clicking on the flag button. If the flag button is red, then you're already in the flag mode.
        - By doing a long press action on a cell. A short vibration will warm you that the action has been done, if you didn't disable vibration in the settings menu."

          - Safe mode : your next will be safe. If you click on a mine, it will put a flg instead of exploding it !
          - Burst mode : it's a powerful move that will reveal all the adjacent cells of where you play ! A flag is put if any of these cells was a mine.
        When you activate a joker, the star will become yellow. If you click ont the flag button, it will cancel the joker and you can reactivate it later.
